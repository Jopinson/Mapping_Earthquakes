# Mapping_Earthquakes
I was tasked to create a map of Earthquakes with Javascript. There are three layers to view on the map. You can sort between earthquakes and major earthquakes as well as look at the boundary lines of the tectonic plates. Earthquake magnitude is measured by color, the darker the color the more intense the earthquake.
